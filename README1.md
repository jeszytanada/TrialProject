   It all started when our predictably heroic hero, Joseph, woke up in a haunted thicket. It was the seventh time it had happened. Feeling barely exasperated, Joseph groped a gerbil, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unaware of the bleakness of existence, he realized that his beloved iPad was missing!  Immediately he called his fundamentalist, guilt-dispensing friend, Jeszy. Joseph had known Jeszy for (plus or minus) 200,000 years, the majority of which were electric ones.  Jeszy was unique. She was outgoing though sometimes a little... insensitive. Joseph called her anyway, for the situation was urgent.

   Jeszy picked up to a very nervous Joseph. Jeszy calmly assured him that most albino cats grimace before mating, yet South American hissing sloths usually charismatically shudder *after* mating. She had no idea what that meant; she was only concerned with distracting Joseph.  Why was Jeszy trying to distract Joseph?  Because she had snuck out from Joseph's with the iPad only ten days prior.  It was a exotic little iPad... how could she resist?

   It didn't take long before Joseph got back to the subject at hand: his iPad. Jeszy grimaced. Relunctantly, Jeszy invited him over, assuring him they'd find the iPad. Joseph grabbed his canoe and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Jeszy realized that she was in trouble. She had to find a place to hide the iPad and she had to do it randomly. She figured that if Joseph took the rice rocket, she had take at least ten minutes before Joseph would get there.  But if he took the Ferrari?  Then Jeszy would be really screwed.

   Before she could come up with any reasonable ideas, Jeszy was interrupted by five funny-smelling tigers that were lured by her iPad. Jeszy sneezed; 'Not again', she thought. Feeling exasperated, she fearlessly reached for her wolverine and deftly groped every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the foxy forest, squealing with discontent. She exhaled with relief.  That's when she heard the Ferrari rolling up.  It was Joseph.

----o0o---- 

   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Jim's House of Wings to pick up a 12-pack of dull pencils, so he knew he was running late.  With a inept leap, Joseph was out of the Ferrari and went scandalously jaunting toward Jeszy's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Jeszy was panicking.  Not thinking, she tossed the iPad into a box of live hand grenades and then slid the box behind her canoe. Jeszy was displeased but at least the iPad was concealed.  The doorbell rang.

   'Come in,' Jeszy charismatically purred.  With a apt push, Joseph opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some annoying beer-sloshed tool in a magic flying carpet,' he lied.  'It's fine,' Jeszy assured him. Joseph took a seat RIGHT next to where Jeszy had hidden the iPad. Jeszy cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide her nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' she blurted.  But Joseph was distracted. Just as zero people expected Jeszy noticed a insensitive look on Joseph's face. Joseph slowly opened his mouth to speak.

   '...What's that smell?'

   Jeszy felt a stabbing pain in her prostate when Joseph asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, she realized that she had hidden the iPad right by her oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A stupid look started to form on Joseph's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's carrots from when she used to have pet 3-legged wallabies.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Joseph nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Jeszy could react, Joseph recklessly lunged toward the box and opened it.  The iPad was plainly in view.

   Joseph stared at Jeszy for what what must've been two millseconds. A few freaknasty minutes later, Jeszy groped flamboyantly in Joseph's direction, clearly desperate. Joseph grabbed the iPad and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Jeszy let out a sassy chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Joseph,' she rebuked. Jeszy always had been a little clueless, so Joseph knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Jeszy did something crazy, like... start chucking ninja stars at her or something. Ever so extemperaneously, he gripped his iPad tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.

   Jeszy looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Joseph. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame three days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly she felt a tinge of concern for Joseph. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Jeszy walked over to the window and looked down. Joseph was gone.

----o0o---- 

   Just yonder, Joseph was struggling to make his way through the haunted thicket behind Jeszy's place. Joseph had severely hurt his shin during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral tigers suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the iPad.  One by one they latched on to Joseph.  Already weakened from his injury, Joseph yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of tigers running off with his iPad.

   About three hours later, Joseph awoke, his armpit throbbing.  It was dark and Joseph did not know where he was.  Deep in the arid swamp, Joseph was very lost. In a tragically predictable turn of events, he remembered that his iPad was taken by the tigers. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life.  That's when, to his horror, a bloated tiger emerged from the lemur-infested moor.  It was the alpha tiger. Joseph opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the tiger sunk its teeth into Joseph's shin. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Joseph's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.

   Less than twenty miles away, Jeszy was entombed by anguish over the loss of the iPad.  'MY PRECIOUS!!' she cried, as she reached for a sharpened carrot.  With a quick thrust, she buried it deeply into her shin.  As the room began to fade to black, she thought about Joseph... wishing she had found the courage to tell him that she loved him.  But she would die alone that day.  All that remained was the iPad that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise.  And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant tigers, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come.  Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead.  So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(
